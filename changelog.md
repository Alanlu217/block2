# Changelog

## v1.3.0
 - Changed play button in editor mode to test. After pressing it, it will allow you to place the squircle somewhere and will retain squircle position and height. Basically just makes testing easier.

## v1.1.0
 - Added spiky platform (currently just red, may make it look better later).

 - Added some death messages, will tell you if u died from floor or a spiky platform.
